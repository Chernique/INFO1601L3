      <h2>Why Won't Students Come to Labs?</h2>
      <p><span class="bold-first-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? This is something I always ponder.<br>
      After unprepared students write exams, They watch their marks in wonder.</p>
      <p><span class="bold-first-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? What is more important than class?<br>
      How can you be a student if you don't even try to pass?</p>
      <p><span class="bold-first-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? It happens all the time.<br>
      If you came to labs, you'd know what to do. But you would rather duck and go lime.</p>
      <p><span class="bold-first-word">Why</span> won't students come to labs? I see them all now stressing.<br>
      If you only learned this basic programming, You would surely now be zessing.</p>
